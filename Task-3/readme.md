# AI-Driven Development (Task-3)

## PART A — Research Questions (Short Answers)

### 1. What new improvements were introduced in Gemini 3.0?
Gemini 3.0 introduces significantly enhanced **"agentic" capabilities** and **state-of-the-art reasoning**, described by Google as their most intelligent model to date.

Key improvements include:
* **"Deep Think" Mode:** For complex, long-horizon problem solving (similar to PhD-level reasoning).
* **Improved Instruction Following:** Greater adherence to specific user constraints.
* **Unified Architecture:** Processes text, image, audio, video, and code simultaneously with greater fluency.
* **Refined Context Window:** A 1-million-token window that allows for massive data ingestion and analysis.

### 2. How does Gemini 3.0 improve coding & automation workflows?
Gemini 3.0 makes coding and daily tasks much easier in three main ways:

* **"Vibe Coding":** Instead of writing small pieces of code one by one, you can just describe your big idea (the "vibe"). The AI will then build the entire project for you, including the plans and the setup files.
* **Working on its Own (Agents):** It acts like a smart assistant that can handle long tasks without needing your help. For example, it can research a topic, write a report about it, and email it to you all by itself.
* **Fixing Mistakes:** Before it runs any code, it "thinks" about what might go wrong. This helps it find and fix its own errors so you don't have to.

### 3. How does Gemini 3.0 improve multimodal understanding?
Gemini 3.0 is touted as the world's best model for multimodal understanding, capable of reasoning across text, images, audio, and video natively and simultaneously.

* **Frame-Level Video Reasoning:** A major upgrade allowing it to analyze specific moments in video clips with high precision.
* **Complex Visual Data:** It can interpret handwritten notes or dense charts and convert them into structured formats (like a family cookbook or a database) with near-perfect accuracy.
* **Mixed Inputs:** It handles different media types (e.g., a video and a PDF) in a single prompt effectively.

### 4. Name any two developer tools introduced with Gemini 3.0.
Two key developer tools introduced with this release are:

1.  **Google Antigravity:** A new agentic development platform designed specifically for building, testing, and deploying autonomous AI agents powered by Gemini 3.
2.  **Gemini CLI (Command Line Interface):** A unified command-line tool that gives developers direct access to Gemini 3.0 Pro capabilities, allowing for faster integration and testing of multimodal prompts directly from the terminal.
